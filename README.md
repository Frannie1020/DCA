ðŸ’¡Abstract:

In recent years, many novel class detection algorithms on data streams have been proposed. 
At present, these algorithms are mainly based on clustering learning and model learning. 
There are three methods based on clustering learning: clustering training data with a single learning model; 
Establishing an integrated classifier based on clustering; Cluster-based class integration classifier. 
The algorithms based on model learning mainly include integrated classifier and new one-class classifier. 
At present, these algorithms mainly have some shortcomings: the distance is difficult to determine, the classification performance is low, 
the classification misjudgment rate is high, and there is no good solution for concept drift and concept evolution.
In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel class detection algorithm dynamic clustering algorithm based on clustering and model learning. 
The main research contents are divided into four parts: modeling, detection, classification, update and verification. 
A new method to reduce the misjudgment rate of boundary instances in detection is proposed. A new classification method is studied. 
Focus on the solution of concept drift and concept evolution: propose update algorithm;
Finally, the algorithm is completed and some tests are carried out, mainly using real data sets and synthetic data sets as test sets and training sets respectively. 
It is verified that this algorithm is superior to other existing algorithms in performance.
